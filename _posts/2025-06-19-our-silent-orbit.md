title: Our Silent Orbit
---

The lock on Anamika’s suitcase made a precise, definitive sound, a small, sharp report in the upstairs hallway. It felt like the sound of a chapter closing. Downstairs, the rhythmic clatter of plastic on the hardwood floor continued, a sound that had become, in the last few weeks, the house’s new metronome. Kabir, it seemed, had not registered the finality of the sound. The world outside his immediate task often seemed to operate on a different frequency.

“He’ll be fine,” Anamika said. She was standing by the door, already wearing her coat. Her hand rested on my arm, a light pressure that asked a question I could not quite parse, a question about my own readiness. I assembled what I hoped was a reassuring smile. “We’ll be fine,” I heard myself say. The words felt like a script.

On Monday, I adhered to the schedule. It seemed immensely important to do so, as if the established sequence of events was a bulwark against some unseen chaos. The blue bowl for his cereal, not the red. The toast cut into eight perfect squares. These were the established parameters of a peaceful morning. As I moved through the kitchen, which was now strangely quiet without Anamika’s radio playing, I found myself observing my own hands as if from a distance, watching them wipe a nearly invisible smudge from the counter, arranging the toast on the plate with an architect’s care. Later during playtime, Kabir constructed a tower of magnetic tiles. It was a flawless, soaring thing of primary colors. I noted his method: he sorted all the pieces by color before beginning the construction. A logical approach. When the tower was complete, a monument to his singular focus, he did not look to me for acknowledgement. He simply swept it to the floor with a clean, decisive motion. The crash was startlingly loud in the silent house. And then, without pause, he began again. I recalled Dr. Albright’s voice, from a room that smelled of antiseptic and old paper files, saying, *“Meet him in his world.”* It seemed a reasonable directive, a clear piece of advice in a sea of ambiguity. I took up a handful of yellow tiles and began my own, smaller tower. It was a clumsy, imbalanced thing. I thought, for a moment, I saw the corner of his mouth shift as he glanced at it, a fleeting impression of amusement, but he was already absorbed again in his work.

Tuesday, at the daycare, I collected him. The building always felt overly warm, thick with the cloying scent of disinfectant and the earthy smell of tempera paint. Ms. Anya, a woman whose kindness seemed both genuine and part of her professional training, caught my eye as we were leaving. “He had a wonderful time with the water table today,” she said, her voice soft. “A little trouble when we had to transition to circle time, but we got there.” She used the word, *transition*. It was one of the new words that had entered our vocabulary, a clinical term for what felt like a painful tearing away. It seemed to hang in the air between us before I nodded and steered Kabir toward the door. On the drive home, I watched him in the rearview mirror as he held his hand up to the window, turning his fingers over and over in the amber light, as if they were a strange and fascinating new object he had just discovered. That evening, in the bath, the room filled with steam, softening the edges of the world. I made a beard of foam on my chin, an old trick from a simpler time. A laugh escaped him, a sudden, bubbling sound that seemed to momentarily alter the acoustics of the room. It was a pure, unanalyzed sound, and for a few seconds, I was simply a father making his son laugh.

Wednesday was the day of the puzzle. A map of the world, two hundred pieces. Anamika had said it was too advanced, her concern a gentle weight. Kabir, however, simply tipped the contents onto the floor and began. He did not consult the picture on the box. He seemed to work from some internal logic, his small hands hovering over the chaotic pile before selecting a piece with unnerving certainty. He recognized the specific curve of a coastline, the particular indent of a gulf. There was an unnerving efficiency to his work. I watched him, my coffee growing cold, feeling a strange combination of pride and something else, something I could not name. A feeling of being a spectator to a private, remarkable performance that I had no part in directing. After he fitted the final piece, he stood, walked to the kitchen, and returned with the blue bowl. He placed it neatly over the island of Madagascar, a perfect, nonsensical coronation. The gesture was entirely his own. He then looked at me, a direct gaze that lasted perhaps three full seconds, before leaning the small, solid weight of his body against my leg. A point of contact. I rested my hand on his hair. It was a simple, parental gesture. One I had performed a thousand times before. Yet, this time, I was aware of the action, aware of myself performing it.

By Thursday, the quiet in the house had acquired a certain texture; it was no longer an absence of sound but a presence of its own. I decided an outing was in order, a trip to the grocery store to procure milk and bread. The decision felt like a mistake the moment we passed through the automatic doors. The long fluorescent lights hummed with a dizzying intensity, and the chorus of beeping scanners and rattling carts seemed to create a physical pressure in the air. I saw a mother and daughter beside the cereal aisle, the girl chattering, her hands fluttering with expression, and I found myself studying them with an intense, almost anthropological curiosity, as if they were a species I had once belonged to. Kabir sat silently in the cart with his hands pressed firmly over his ears, his face a mask of concentration. I moved through the aisles with a new, urgent efficiency, my own heart beating a strange, frantic rhythm against my ribs. It was a profound relief to be back in the car. The silence was a balm. After a moment, Kabir took his hands from his ears and began to hum, a low, steady, tuneless sound. Without thinking, I found myself humming along, a separate, dissonant melody to fill the small, safe space.

Friday evening, a profound tiredness had settled deep in my bones, the kind that feels like a physical weight. The week felt much longer than five days. I looked at Kabir, who was now arranging his tiles into a long, straight line that traversed the entire length of the living room rug. A chasm of silence seemed to lie between us. On an impulse born of a quiet desperation, I pulled a large, flat box from the top of the hall closet. The solar system model I had bought months ago, on a day when the future had felt brighter and less complicated.

As I spilled the plastic planets onto the floor, his eyes widened. I reached for the instruction booklet, but he was already at work, snapping the plastic arms into the central sun. He picked up the great, banded sphere of Jupiter and found its place. He worked with a silent, focused intensity that was both remarkable and isolating. I put the instructions down. My role, I understood, was simply to hand him the pieces. Mars. Venus. Neptune. He took each one without a word, his attention fully captured.

When only one planet remained, the pale blue dot of Earth, he picked it up and held it. The house was utterly still; even the refrigerator had ceased its humming. He looked at me, then at the small blue and green marble in his palm. He held it out. His fingers were still faintly sticky from the jam he’d had with his dinner. I opened my hand, and he placed the Earth there. Then, with his own small hand, he closed my fingers around it. He held them there, a firm, deliberate squeeze that lasted for a long moment, a tangible pressure against my palm. He didn't need to look at me. The analytical part of my mind, the part that had been taking notes and making observations all week, went silent. All I could feel was the surprising warmth of his hand, the hard plastic sphere pressing into my skin, and the quiet, undeniable gravity that held us there, in our own small, silent orbit. The house was no longer empty. It was full.
