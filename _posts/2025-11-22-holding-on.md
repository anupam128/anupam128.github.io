title: Holding On
---
The cold had ceased to be an intruder; it was a resident now, settling into the furniture and the pile of blankets where they lived. The apartment smelled of stale wool and the dry, chalky scent of plaster that hadn't moved in days.
Sami giggled, a sound as thin as paper. "Do the wolf, Papa."
Adam’s hands shifted in the flashlight’s pale cone. The batteries were weak, casting the shadow against the wall in soft, fuzzy gray edges. He curled his fingers, and the snout appeared—not a monster, just a creature.
"He is quiet tonight," Adam whispered.
"Is he hunting?" Sami asked, watching the wall.
"No. He is waiting. Wolves are very good at waiting."
Sami tucked his chin into the oversized collar of his sweater. "What is he waiting for?"
"For the moon," Adam said. "And for a biscuit. A round one."
"The blue tin," Sami said. He didn't ask it as a question this time. He just said it, testing the weight of the memory. "The one with the sugar."
Adam looked at the shadow-wolf. He didn't make it howl or dance. He just let it breathe on the wall, his own hand rising and falling with his chest. "Yes. The blue tin."
Sami looked away from the shadow. He looked at the kitchen door, which was closed to keep the draft out. He knew the cupboards behind it were open and empty, like hungry mouths.
"Mama took the key to the cupboard," Sami said softly.
It was a new logic, one the boy had invented to make sense of the hunger. Adam didn't correct him. It was a kinder truth than the real one.
"She did," Adam said. "She wanted to keep them safe."
Outside, the horizon grumbled. It wasn't a sharp sound, but a low, rolling thud, like heavy furniture being moved in the apartment upstairs. The taped-up windowpane hummed in its frame, a heavy resonance that you felt in your chest before you heard the sound.
Sami didn't flinch. He was used to the sounds. "They are closer," he observed.
Adam stiffened. He had been tracking the thuds for three nights. Two days ago, they were a distant thunder. Yesterday, they were at the river. Tonight, they were at the bridge.
"A little closer," Adam admitted.
"Are we moving to the camp?" Sami asked.
The question hung in the cold air. The "camp" was a word they heard on the radio before the batteries died. It was a place of tents and soup, somewhere to the south. But going there meant leaving the door. It meant if she came back, she would find an empty house.
"Not yet," Adam said, the lie tasting of ash. "We are waiting for the signal."
"What signal?"
"The... the morning," Adam improvised weakly.
The flashlight flickered. It didn't pop or fizzle; it simply faded. The yellow beam turned orange, then a dull red, effectively dissolving the shadow-wolf into the wall. Then, it was gone.
The darkness was absolute. It rushed into the room, filling the space between them, pressing against their eyes.
"Papa?" Sami’s voice was small, drifting in the void.
"I'm here." Adam reached out, his fingers brushing the wool of the sweater. He found the boy's shoulder and pulled him in.
"The wolf is gone."
"He's just sleeping," Adam whispered. He clicked the switch back and forth. Nothing. The batteries were dead. The last anchor to their little world was severed.
They sat in the dark, listening. Without the light to focus on, the sounds outside grew heavier. The thudding was rhythmic now. Thump... thump... thump. It wasn't random shelling anymore. It was a knock at the door of the city.
"Are we still waiting for the signal?" Sami murmured, his voice thick with sleep.
Adam swallowed the grit in his throat. He looked at the invisible door, the empty cupboard, the place where the blue tin used to be. "Yes," he lied, staring into the blackness. "We are waiting."
"Okay," Sami breathed. "I'm good at waiting."
The boy shifted, nesting into the curve of Adam’s body, trusting him completely to hold the world in place. Slowly, the tension left Sami’s small frame. His breathing evened out, becoming a soft, steady rhythm against the violent percussion of the night.
Adam rested his hand over Sami’s chest.
Up and down.
Up and down.
The rhythm was faint through the thick wool, but it was there. Warm. Persistent.
Adam looked up. In the crushing dark, his eyes sought the outline of the kitchen door. He stared at the empty space where the blue tin used to be. He listened, straining against the thumping outside, waiting for the creak of a hinge, a footstep, anything.
Silence.
The floor lurched, a dry groan from the building's joints.
Adam looked back down at the bundle in his arms. The boy was asleep, his chest rising and falling against Adam’s palm.
It was the quietest battle of the war— life is a constant struggle between holding on and letting go. Adam realized, with a sudden, sharp clarity, that he couldn't do both.
Adam closed his fingers, gripping the fabric of Sami's sweater. He turned his face away from the kitchen. He pressed his cheek into the boy’s hair, inhaling the scent of dust and life. A single, hot tear trailed into his beard.
"Sleep now, little wolf," Adam whispered into the blackness. "Say goodbye to the room."
Sami didn't stir.
"Tomorrow," Adam breathed, "we walk."
